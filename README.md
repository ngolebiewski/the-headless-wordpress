# React frontend for HEADLESS (horseman) WORDPRESS 
### I've had a Word Press artist portfolio for 10 years with a custom theme. It's busted with current php 8. I was thinking of starting from scratch, but read that you can use wordpress as an API, so the new challenge will be to use what I have to build the site. Notes here. 

# Can I do this with my WP

- Yes! Put in your URL and then   
- wp-json
- /wp-json/wp/v2
- etc. I'm still figuring this out

# Structure

- Previously artwork series were saved with categories and tags using posts
- NOW: remake pages
- Add db field to images to put a page name they should get pulled into.
